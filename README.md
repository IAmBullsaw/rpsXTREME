I had this Idea some time ago where one simple change of rules to Rock Paper Scissors would make a tournament possibly hilarious.

* The winner of a match gains the move his or her opponent lost with. The opponent loses this move as well.

So, for a tournament it is possible that the finale would end due to loss of possible moves.

# Rules

* A player starts with 1 rock, 1 paper, 1 scissors.
* A player is not allowed to use a move if he or she has zero or less moves of this kind left.
* A match is set of 5 turns.
* A player loses if the player has no moves left.
* A player gains 2 points for a won turn.
* A player gains 1 point for a tied turn.
* A player never loses points.


## Additional rules

Alternative rules has been discussed such as
* Giving a player a random move at the beginning of each choice
